## Introduction

`giants` is a simple package that provides python support for tuning `sklearn` models via hyperparameter searches. There are a series of pre-defined configurations and hyperparameter grids defined for a series of models, which should be fairly easy to extend as needed.

It was originally developed for the [Big Trees project](https://github.com/forestobservatory/cfo-big-trees) but we found it useful enough to clean it up and publish it as a standalone package for easy re-use.

## Install

```bash
pip install giants
```
